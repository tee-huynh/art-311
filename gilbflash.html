  <h1><br />The bodies.</h1>
  <p><br />It was 3 days prior. You heard some knocking on the door - the general.
<br /><br />
Apparently some soldiers were getting sick, coughing up blood, nothing normal.
Not only that, but their skin turned cold, quickly too. Shortly after, they'd collapse.
<br /><br />
They were still alive, just barely anyways. The heart barely beating enough to keep them alive.
<br /><br />
The general wanted to know what was going on - but you knew this meant cutting them up.
<br /><br />
They were still alive after all.

 <br /></p>
