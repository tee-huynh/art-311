  <h1><br />Let her be.</h1>
  <p><br />Maybe she will find peace soon after turning.
Hopefully it won't even be her at that point anymore.
<br /><br />
Asides from being your caretaker, she had been hiding you in that church since the outbreak.
You were the only survivor from the children of the orphanage, who knows why.
<br /><br />
She wouldn't talk about it. It doesn't matter anymore, it's time to leave this place.
