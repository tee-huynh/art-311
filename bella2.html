  <h1><br />Don't let her turn.</h1>
  <p><br />You weren't going to let her turn into one of those things.
<br /><br />
You took a knife and ended her life.
It's as if she never even noticed.
<br /><br />
Asides from being your caretaker, she had been hiding you in that church since the outbreak.
You were the only survivor from the children of the orphanage, who knows why.
<br /><br />
She wouldn't talk about it. It doesn't matter anymore, it's time to leave this place.
