  <h1><br />Continue fighting</h1>
  <p><br />You decide it's not over yet. But it might be soon if you don't get more supplies.
<br /><br />
You make your way outside the camp, and reach Ryan's cave.
<br /><br />
You'd met Ryan early after the outbreak. He seemed off, not infected no, he just heard voices.
Said he was destined too, destined to live in this cave for some reason.
<br /><br />
He was probably just under insane guilt, being a military runaway and all.
You don't know what happened to Ryan, about a year ago he just disappeared.
Hopefully he found peace in the world.
<br /><br />
Suddenly, you hear a voice coming from the cave...
