  <h1><br />Set up Camp</h1>
  <p><br />You don't know why...but you decide to stay here in this cave.
<br /><br />
You eventually start hearing that the sick have been turning into some sort of cannibal monsters, and that just about
every child has passed away from the disease.
<br /><br />
Maybe you'll be more use to people by setting up camp here, and helping out bypassers.
<br /><br />
You see a vision. A child, attempting to get down this cave's hill, soon after, a landslide.
You're not sure what this means...are you getting sick as well? No...you're not coughing.
<br /><br />
You decide to create a secret entrance to the cave and mark it , maybe if this vision is a prophecy, the child's curiosity will lead him or her safely down the hill.
