  <h1><br />Moral Scientist</h1>
  <p><br />She meant the world to you, but you knew it wasn't right to take other's lives for a chance to save her.
She passed soon after.
<br /><br />
It's been three years now, still no cure.
Maybe it was the carefulness, or plain cruel luck, but you're still alive in this hell.
<br /><br />
After a week or so of the cold coma, the stronger ones came back to life, or at least something did.
You don't like to think about what they are, you just know it's a good idea to avoid them.
<br /><br />
It hurts to think about it, but her death was imminent. The disease was far more contagious to
children, and it didn't turn them like the adults, it just killed them straight up.
<br /><br />
Sometimes you wonder if this is God's final judgement, and if there's any hope left in the world.
