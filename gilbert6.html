  <h1><br />It could be a zombie</h1>
  <p><br />You decide not to check the cave, and make your way to the town. 
<br /><br />
You don't want to go into that cave anyways; there was a recent infestation of venemous scorpions.
<br /><br />
You continue your trek to the town, hopefully they'll have some good stuff this time around - maybe even some donuts!
