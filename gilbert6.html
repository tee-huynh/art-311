  <h1><br />Continue your trek</h1>
  <p><br />You continue walking towards the town, passing the cave.
<br /><br />
It's a shame what happened to Ryan's home; the infestation of venemous scorpions and all.
With all these cannibal maniacs running around, you'd think we'd catch a break once in a while.
<br /><br />
You get closer to town, hopefully they'll have some good stuff this time around - maybe even some donuts!
<br /><br />
You don't know how much longer you'll last. It's not like you're ever safe from the plague, it's gotta
be in the air or something.
<br /><br />
Here's hoping for a cure, for the sake of us all.
