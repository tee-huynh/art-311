  <h1><br />Drift off into eternal sleep</h1>
  <p><br />You'd been thinking of it for a while now.
<br /><br />
You decide to do it, and euthanize yourself.
<br /><br />
Right before dozing off, you get a vision. A child; but not your daughter.
She's unconscious, at the bottom of a hill. You recognize that hill, it's just outside the camp.
Is this a sign? What have you done...
<br /><br />
You dread your final moments.

 <br /></p>
