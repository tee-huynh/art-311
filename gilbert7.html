  <h1><br />Inspect the cave</h1>
  <p><br />You know the place is long deserted and dangerous, but something urges you to check it out anyways.
<br /><br />
You find a lonely kid...what is she doing out here on her own?
This is the first live child you have seen since the outbreak.
<br /><br />
You return to the lab. The ruined lands are no place for a child. It is safer here. Taking small blood samples from this interesting child, you realize that this is the ingredient you had been looking for.
<br /><br />
A cure is not found instantly, no. However, progress is being made. On an up note, having her in the lab reminds you of simpler times, when yours was still around.
