  <h1><br />Become a fugitive</h1>
  <p><br />You decide to run, using the sick as a distraction.
<br /><br />
You spend the night in a nearby cave, not too big, and located just between a nearby town and the base.
You are awoken by screams. People are running, with children on their backs, they seem to be coming from the town. You don't like the looks of things.
