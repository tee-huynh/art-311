  <h1><br />Stay quiet.</h1>
  <p><br />You take another step further to look at a picture frame hanging on the wall. It’s of a family of three- a mother, father, and son. They’re all smiling so brightly.
<br /><br />
This reminds you of the times before the pandemic began. It feels so long ago that you were just a toddler eating your mother’s freshly baked cookies and getting tickled by your father and hearing his laughs mix with yours.
<br /><br />
You’re too lost in your thoughts that you don’t see the same glint of light from before quickly approaching you until it’s too late.
<br /><br />
The last thing you see is the shine of a knife aiming straight for your neck.
<br /><br />
Everything goes black.
