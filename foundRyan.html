  <h1><br />You find a man.</h1>
  <p><br />He looks to be a soldier and he has made camp in the cave.
<br /><br />
It was surprising to find another human being unaffected by the disease.
<br /><br />
You two are both wary at first but after a couple hours of sitting in silence around the fire, you two begin to start talking. 
<br /><br />
You learn all about him and his story, and he learns about yours. For some reason you feel safe around him. Maybe you two can make this pandemic a little less lonely and work together.
